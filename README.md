# Unmanned Vehicles Projects

## Overview

This repository contains Python and MATLAB files related to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones. The projects cover various aspects of drone simulation, control, and dynamics modeling. Both Python and MATLAB are used for different implementations, from flight control algorithms to path planning and sensor integration.

## Key Features

- **Flight Control Algorithms**: Implementations of PID, LQR, and other control strategies for stabilizing and controlling drones.
- **Path Planning**: Algorithms for planning optimal drone paths using techniques like A*, RRT, and potential fields.
- **Dynamic Modeling**: Simulation of drone dynamics using mathematical models to analyze flight behavior under different conditions.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Both Python and MATLAB implementations for flexibility in control design and simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Python and MATLAB files in this repository, you will need:

- **Python 3.x**: Install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt`.
- **MATLAB**: For running the MATLAB scripts, ensure you have MATLAB installed with the necessary toolboxes for control systems and simulation.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unmannedvehicles.git
   cd unmannedvehicles
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the MATLAB scripts in MATLAB and run them directly from the interface.

### Running the Code

- **Python**: To run a Python script, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python drone_control.py
   ```

- **MATLAB**: Open a `.m` file in MATLAB, such as `drone_simulation.m`, and run it by pressing the "Run" button or typing the file name in the command window.
